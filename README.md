# FBI Wanted
FBI Wanted is a single page react application that gives users a user friendly site to effortlessly explore the FBI's database of wanted persons.

# Motivation
It was shortly after the attack at the capitol that I had discovered that the FBI has a free API for accessing their database of wanted persons.  The API turned out not to be very developer friendly which slowed down the site a little bit but in the end this site fills a need that is extremely relevant to the world today.

# Technologies Used
- React
- Node.js & Express

# Back End Server
Due to a lack of accessibility to the FBI API, it could only be accessed by a node server, not through JS in the browser.  Click [here](https://github.com/BrandonP321/fbi-wanted-server) to visit the repository and README for the server.

# Features
- Mobile responsive design
- Search bar and filters for navigating API

# Installation
Upon cloning the repo to your local machine, you just need to run `npm install` 

# Contributing
Due to this being a small project for my portfolio I am not open to contributions at this time.
